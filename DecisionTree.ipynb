    "How It Works (Step-by-Step)\n",

    "14. How does a Decision Tree handle categorical features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees can handle categorical features directly, but often require preprocessing like one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct Handling:\n",
    ". Some decision tree implementations, like ID3, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are designed to handle categorical variables directly.\n",
    ". These algorithms can split the tree based on the presence or absence of specific categories within a feature.\n",
    ". This means you don't need to explicitly encode categorical features into numerical format before training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-processing with One-Hot Encoding:\n",
    ". Many decision tree algorithms, especially those in libraries like Scikit-learn, require numerical input. \n",
    ". To use these algorithms with categorical data, you typically need to pre-process the data by encoding categorical features. \n",
    ". One-hot encoding: is a common technique where each category in a categorical feature is converted into a binary column (0 or 1), indicating the \n",
    "  presence or absence of that category. \n",
    ". This transforms the categorical data into a format suitable for the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    ". Consider a feature \"Color\" with categories \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\". \n",
    ". Direct handling: The decision tree might split based on \"Is the color Red?\".\n",
    ". One-hot encoding: The \"Color\" feature would be converted into three separate binary features: \"Color_Red\", \"Color_Green\", and \"Color_Blue\". The\n",
    "  decision tree could then split based on these binary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Pre-processing:\n",
    "Compatibility with Algorithms:\n",
    "One-hot encoding ensures that the data is in a numerical format suitable for algorithms that require numerical input. \n",
    "Feature Importance:\n",
    "One-hot encoding can make it easier to evaluate the importance of individual categories within a categorical feature. \n",
    "In summary, while some decision tree algorithms can handle categorical features directly, many require pre-processing, often in the form of one-hot \n",
    "encoding, to convert categorical data into a numerical format suitable for the algorithm.\n",
